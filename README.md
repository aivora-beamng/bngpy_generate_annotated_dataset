# Generate Annotated Datasets With BeamNGpy

This is a script with which you can generate your own datasets with semantic annotation.
The possible settings and options are documented in `generate_annotated_dataset.py`.

## Compatibility
This script has been tested with BeamNGpy 1.23.1 and BeamNG.tech 0.25.5.0. Other versions are not tested and will probably require changes to the script.

## How to run

pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_annotated_dataset.py
```
